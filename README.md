# Welcome to John Mattox's image-tools

This repository gathers several smaller projects that deal with images in general. Some tools may include image preprocessing, filters, object detection, auto-embedding and more.


## Tools

 - **Photo scan cropper:** When scanning old analogic photos, we usually add several of them to the scanner table and end up with an image file with white background and multiple pictures inside. This tool can crop the images and unskew them. In a future version, an enhancement filter will allow the user to get better quality results based on AI (U-Nets).
